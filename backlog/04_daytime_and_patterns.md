### Task: Implement Daytime Traffic Flow Patterns

**Description:**
Develop and integrate daytime traffic flow patterns to simulate realistic traffic scenarios. The simulation should account for varying traffic directions during different times of the day to mimic real-world rush hours.

**Details:**
- **Morning Rush Hour:**
  - **Cars:** Majority moving southbound.
  - **Trucks:** Majority moving westbound.
- **Evening Rush Hour:**
  - **Cars:** Majority moving northbound.
  - **Trucks:** Majority moving eastbound.

**Steps:**
1. Define traffic flow directions for morning and evening rush hours.
2. Implement traffic generation logic to allocate vehicles based on time of day.
3. Adjust traffic signal timings to accommodate varying flows.
4. Test scenarios to ensure flows adhere to specified directions during rush hours.
5. Document any adjustments made to existing traffic management logic.
