# Fix Vehicle Movement Issues

## Description
Vehicles are stopping in the middle of the road instead of at traffic lights, and vehicles aren't properly proceeding through green lights in the left/right directions. These issues need to be fixed to ensure proper traffic flow.

## Current Implementation
- The Vehicle.move() method has complex conditions for determining when vehicles should move
- The `should_move` condition in the move() method may be causing vehicles to stop prematurely
- The `crossed` flag might not be set correctly for all directions
- Signal timing and coordination may be causing issues with vehicle movement

## Requirements
1. Fix the vehicle movement logic to ensure vehicles stop at traffic lights
2. Ensure vehicles properly proceed through green lights in all directions
3. Maintain proper spacing between vehicles
4. Preserve the existing traffic signal timing system

## Steps
1. Review and simplify the `should_move` condition in the Vehicle.move() method
2. Check the `crossed` flag setting logic for all directions
3. Verify the stop line positions and default stop positions
4. Test the signal timing coordination
5. Add debugging output to track vehicle positions and signal states

## Expected Outcome
- Vehicles will stop at traffic lights when the signal is red
- Vehicles will proceed through green lights in all directions
- Vehicles will maintain proper spacing
- Traffic flow will be more realistic and efficient

## Status
Pending

## Priority
High
