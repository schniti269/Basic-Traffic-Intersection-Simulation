# Vectorized AI Model Interfaces

## Description
The current AI model interfaces do not efficiently represent the state of all vehicles in a vectorized format. We need to restructure the interfaces to provide position, speed, direction, and type information for all vehicles in a format that's more suitable for AI processing.

## Current Implementation
- The TrafficEnvironment.get_state() method returns a state vector with aggregated information
- The state doesn't include detailed information about individual vehicles
- The environment does not provide vectorized access to all vehicle attributes

## Requirements
1. Create a vectorized representation of the traffic state that includes all vehicles
2. Include position, speed, direction, and type information for each vehicle
3. Structure the data in a format that's easily consumable by AI models
4. Ensure the interface is consistent and well-documented

## Steps
1. Design a new state representation format that includes detailed vehicle information
2. Modify the TrafficEnvironment.get_state() method to return the new format
3. Update any dependent code to handle the new state format
4. Add methods to efficiently query vehicle information by type, direction, etc.
5. Document the new interface design and usage

## Expected Outcome
- A more comprehensive state representation that includes detailed vehicle information
- Better AI model performance due to more detailed input data
- More flexible querying of the simulation state
- Improved extensibility for future AI models

## Status
Pending

## Priority
High
